# ActiveOneTest

This is the repository in which you can find the codebase delivered to accomplish the technical test for Active One.

## Design decisions
The design was based on the layout example founded on the test detail document, the final result is not exactly the same but used as a reference helped to implement the screen with all the information required and the different sections. 

All the information was organized in a singular scrollable view with three different sections to show the details of the loan information.

In order to accomodate the design to the different screen sizes, I relied on the SwiftUI framework that allows to use declarations to setup the location and organization of each component in the layout, enabling the UI to accomodate to the different screen variations.

## Assumptions

- The app was created with the latest Xcode version.
- The models were created based on the json structure.
